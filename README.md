<h1>Configuring Group Policy Management</h1>

 

<h2>Description</h2>
In this phase of my IT helpdesk home lab, I will configure Group Policy Management (GPM) to enforce security settings, user permissions, and system configurations across my domain. Group Policy Objects (GPOs) are essential in an enterprise environment for managing user and computer settings centrally.
By mastering Group Policy Management, I will develop critical skills in securing and maintaining IT environments, troubleshooting policy-related issues, and ensuring compliance with organizational IT policies.
